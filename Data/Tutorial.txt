All commands are composed of two words
For example, USE BUCKET or EXAMINE BOOKCASE
There are four main commands in the corridor
GO, LOOK, TAKE and EXAMINE
GO moves you in a direction
LOOK tells you what is in a direction in the room you are in
TAKE picks up an item you can access in the room you are in
EXAMINE gives you more information about an item in the room you are in
You can GO and LOOK either NORTH, EAST, SOUTH or WEST
So to go north you type GO NORTH
To look east you type LOOK EAST
For all commands you can use just the first initial of the word
For example G NORTH or L EAST
For directions you can also use just the first initial of the word
For example GO N, LOOK E, or even G N, L E
TAKE and EXAMINE must be followed by an item
For example TAKE BUCKET OR EXAMINE PIPES or T BUCKET, E PIPES
In 'The Corridor', words in bold indicate an item you can take or examine
"There is a FIREPLACE in front of you" indicates that you can interact with FIREPLACE
It doesn't matter if you type in upper or lower case
